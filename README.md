# ArtGallery

Welcome to the ArtGallery repository! ArtGallery is a dynamic web application designed to showcase a curated collection of artworks. This application is structured into a frontend and backend, encapsulating the user interface and data management logic separately for better maintainability and scalability.

## Quick Start

To get ArtGallery up and running on your machine, ensure you have Docker installed and follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adi-Hershko/ArtGallery.git
   cd ArtGallery
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Images**

   Navigate to both the backend and frontend directories to build their respective Docker images:

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   docker build -t backend:latest .
   cd ../Frontend
   docker build -t frontend:latest .
   ```

   This will create the Docker images for both parts of the application.

3. **Run Docker Compose**

   Return to the root directory of the project and run Docker Compose to start the application:

   ```bash
